    "- It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is a programming language that is easy to understand and write, making it a popular choice among developers and programmers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is compatible with various programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has a large and active community of developers, an extensive standard library, and third-party packages for various domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Python is popular for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to Learn & Readable – Its simple syntax is similar to English, making it beginner-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Versatile & General-Purpose – Python can be used for web development, data science, automation, AI, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Huge Community Support – A vast number of libraries, frameworks, and an active community make development faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Great for AI & Data Science – Libraries like TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-learn make it a top choice for ML and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross-Platform – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without major modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automation & Scripting – Many use Python to automate repetitive tasks, saving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strong Job Market – Many companies use Python, making it a high-demand skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line rather than compiling the entire code before running it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "It reads and executes the code directly, making Python an interpreted language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Functions of a Python Interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reads the source code: Takes your .py file as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converts to bytecode: Translates human-readable Python code into bytecode (intermediate representation).\n",

    "- Types of Python Interpreters:\n",

    "# 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
    "- Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples of keywords include if, else, while, for, def, class, import, try, except, return, True, False, None, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keywords are case-sensitive and cannot be redefined or overridden within a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
    "    \n",
    "No,\n",
    "\n",
    "Since keywords already have predefined roles, using them as variable names would cause \"syntax errors\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will not allow you to assign values to keywords\n",

    "# 5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
    "- In Python, objects can be changeable (modifiable) \n",
    "\n",
    "- Mutable objects, such as lists and dictionaries, can be modified after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mutability affects how objects are stored and manipulated in memory, impacting performance, memory usage, and concurrency in Python programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Lists are mutable because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are designed to hold sequences of items that might change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add, remove, or change elements in a list without creating a whole new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This makes them super flexible and efficient for operations like appending, popping, or modifying items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- lists are implemented as dynamic arrays, which can change in size and contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Tuples are immutable because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They’re meant to represent fixed collections of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This makes them safe to use as dictionary keys or elements in a set, which require immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also gives some performance benefits (like faster iteration), and ensures data integrity. \n",

    "# 9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python or type conversion in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python supports a wide variety of functions or methods like: int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type casting is necessary for performing arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and input/output operations in Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
    "\n",
    " - Implicit type casting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python automatically converts one data type to another without programmer intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "This usually happens when performing operations between different data types, where Python converts the lower data type to a higher data type to prevent data loss.                        \n",
    "\n",
    "    x = 10              \n",
    "    y = 2.5\n",
    "    z = x + y  # x is implicitly converted to float before addition\n",
    "    print(z)    # Output: 12.5\n",
    "    print(type(z)) # Output: <class 'float'>\n",
    "\n",
    " - Explicit type casting:\n",
    "     \n",
    "   The programmer manually converts a data type using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), bool(), etc. \n",
    "     \n",
    "    This is necessary when Python cannot automatically perform the conversion or when a specific data type is required\n",
    "        \n",
    "     a = \"123\"\n",
    "    b = int(a)  # Explicitly convert string to integer\n",
    "    print(b)    # Output: 123\n",
    "    print(type(b)) # Output: <class 'int'>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " # 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    " - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow your program to make decisions and execute certain blocks of code \n",
    "  only when specific conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    " - They let your program react differently depending on input or the current state — like an \"if this, then that\" logic.   \n",
    "\n",
    "   Common conditional statements:\n",
    "     \n",
    "  - if: Executes a block of code if a condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - elif: Short for \"else if\" – checks another condition if the previous ones are False.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - else: Executes a block of code if none of the previous conditions were True. \n",
    "\n",
    "        age = 18\n",
    "\n",
    "    if age >= 18:\n",

    "\n",
    " # 12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "  How it works:\n",
    "     \n",
    "- Python checks the if condition first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the if condition is True, it runs that block and skips the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If it's False, it moves to the elif and checks that condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can have multiple elif statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If none of the if or elif conditions are True, the else block runs (if it exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "     Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "temperature = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "if temperature > 30: \n",
    "     \n",
